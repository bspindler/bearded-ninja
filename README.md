=============

A svn pre-commit hook that allows you to freeze code down to the path level with token level overrides for individual access.  I wrote this script to allow me to bring the code to a slush state (essentially frozen with only authorized commits (those with tokens) allowed), the following features are available: 

<ul>
	<li>Path level locking/freezing.</li>
	<li>Token based authorizations - coupled with issue management association</li>
</ul>
